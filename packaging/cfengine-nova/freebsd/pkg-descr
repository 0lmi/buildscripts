CFEngine is an automated suite of programs for configuring and
maintaining Unix-like computers. It has been used on computing arrays
of between 1 and 30,000 computers since 1993 by a wide range of
organizations. CFEngine is supported by active research and was the
first autonomic, hands-free management system for Unix-like operating
systems. CFEngine is an autonomic maintenance system not merely a
change management roll-out tool. CFEngine has a history of security
and adaptability.
