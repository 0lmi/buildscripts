Prerequisites
.............

Due to sheer diversity of the environments, build machine is expected to provide
strict minimum amount of software (don't forget --no-install-recommends on
dpkg-based systems):

To access the build machine:
 * SSH server
  * Bundled one on Unixes
  * FreeSSHd on Windows
 * 'build' account with SSH key installed

To transfer files back and forth:
 * rsync on Unixes
 * 7z on Windows

To be able to install packages and run tests:
 * passwordless sudo access for 'build' account
 * sudo should not require TTY (remove 'Defaults requiretty' from /etc/sudoers)

To build everything:
 * GCC (gcc)
 * GNU make (make)
 * libc development package (libc-dev, glibc-devel)
 * bison (bison)
 * flex (flex)
 * fakeroot (but not fakeroot 1.12, it is horribly slow!)

To create packages:
 * Native packaging manager
  * rpm-build on RPM-based systems
  * dpkg-dev, debhelper, fakeroot
  * WiX on Windows

To build MySQL library (yeah!):
 * g++ (gcc-c++, g++)
 * ncurses (ncurses-devel, libncurses5-dev)

To build libvirt:
 * pkg-config (pkg-config, pkgconfig)

Anything else is either preprocessed on buildbot slave or built and installed
during build.

Documentation build pre-requisites
..................................

 * texinfo
 * texlive
 * cm-super
 * texlive-fonts-extra

Non-requisites
..............

Build machines should not contain the following items, which may interfere with
build process:

 * CFEngine itself, either in source or binary form (build machines are
   short-living, so this is not a problem)
 * Development packages for anything beside libc to avoid picking them up
   instead of bundled ones accidentally.
 * MySQL and PostgreSQL servers, clients and libraries

The following packages should not be installed on build machines as well, to
avoid accidentally regenerating files transferred from buildslave:

 * automake
 * autoconf
 * libtool
